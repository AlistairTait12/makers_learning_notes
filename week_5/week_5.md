# Week 5 - The Web
## Learning Objectives
### Write feature tests using Capybara
> ---**Gemfile Creation**---  
> Minor note, I learned how to do this in the Oystercard challenge but had to do it again this week. 
> 1. Run `bundle init` to create a blank 'Gemfile'
> 2. Add any dependencies like so: 
```ruby
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem 'capybara'
gem 'selenium-webdriver'
```
> 3. Run command `bundle` in the CLI and this will get all the necessary files and add them as dependencies in `Gemfile.lock`
> 4. You may need to run `bundle install` to install any downloaded dependencies  
  
I gave the Capybara workout a try and had some installation issues at first. Luckily, a guide from another cohort member came in extremely useful. After giving it a try, I quickly realised how useful Capybara will be for automating tests of webpages and webapps. The syntax is extremely intuitive and I look forward to using it to write tests.
