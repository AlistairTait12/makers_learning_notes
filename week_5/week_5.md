# Week 5 - The Web
## Write feature tests using Capybara
> ---**Gemfile Creation**---  
> Minor note, I learned how to do this in the Oystercard challenge but had to do it again this week. 
> 1. Run `bundle init` to create a blank 'Gemfile'
> 2. Add any dependencies like so: 
```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

source "https://rubygems.org"

# git_source(:github) {|repo_name| "https://github.com/#{repo_name}" }

gem 'capybara'
gem 'selenium-webdriver'
```
> 3. Run command `bundle` in the CLI and this will get all the necessary files and add them as dependencies in `Gemfile.lock`
> 4. You may need to run `bundle install` to install any downloaded dependencies
