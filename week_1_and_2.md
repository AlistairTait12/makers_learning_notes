# Weeks 1 and 2!

## Summary of My Experience so far:
### 1. Setup and configuration
### 2. Using the Command Line Interface/ Mac OS Terminal
### 3. Version Control/ Git and GitHub
### 4. Ruby Mastery Learning, Quizzes
### 5. Problem Solving
### 6. Peek at TDD

## Setup and configuration
#### TL;DR - setup various tools within my coding environment
This was a simple case of preparing my coding environment on the MacBook Air on loan from Makers. The main tools I installed were:
* **Xcode command line tools**
* **Homebrew**
* **Ruby and RVM (Ruby Version Manager)**
* Pry
* Heroku

(The tools in bold are what I have made use of *so far*). I had a few issues with the setup. Xcode installed without issue but I had some issues with the Homebrew setup. This, in turn, led to me not being able to install the version of ruby required for the mastery quizzes
