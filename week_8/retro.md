# Better?
- Not enough planning?
  - Even though it felt like we did
  - More time planning may have resulted in better end result?
  - Didn't use story points
- Not enough use of resources?
  - Better use of mockups?
- Could have focussed more on our strengths
  - i.e. we used random team generators to split work because we couldn't decide on what to focus on as individuals
- More commits, more pull requests

# Well?
- Learned activerecord
- Learned about branches, pull requests and a strategy to safely merge our branches to a 'pre main' branch to avoid breaking the main branch
