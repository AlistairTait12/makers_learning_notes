# Simple Banking App
#### This is an exercise in creating a test driven app exclusively from a collection of user stories
> As a customer,  
> So that I can keep my money safe,  
> I would like to deposit money in my account
    
> As a customer,  
> So that I can spend my money,  
> I would like to withdraw money from my account  
  
> As a customer,  
> So that I can budget,  
> I would like to view my balance  

My basic approach as follows
Let the demands inspire the tests, let the tests inspire the code
1. Analyse the user stories and find out what the user wants
2. Devise tests based on the features they want and what you expect the app to do
3. Write the tests and be guided by the error messages for writing your code
4. Make small changes, ensuring the error messages change and/or the tests still pass at each stage
5. Repeat the cycle with increasing complexity to the tests as you progress towards fulfilling the user requirements
