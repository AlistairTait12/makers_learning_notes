# Feedback!
### Scenario:
> My teammate goes of coding tangents whereas I like to focus on the task at hand  
  
* Please slow down and explain each point  
* Try and get them to link what they are saying back to the task at hand  
* Be a good receiver of feedback  

## Talk: Mastering Feedback using EQ
**What is feedback**?  
> Informations about reactions to a product, a person's performance of a task, or behavior, which is used as a basis for improvement.  
  
**Why is feedback so difficult**?  
**Receiving**  
* If you feel you are doing a good job of something you can feel disheartened
* Take it as criticism
* Take it as they don't like you in general
* Might think you are doing a bad job overall
* Can come across as condescending

**Providing**  
* Can feel arrogant giving feedback
* Have to choose wording carefully

Love and Acceptance vs Learning and Growth  
How can we make it easier? Be resilient.  
1. **Shift your perspective**
    * Only feedback, not positive or negative. 
    * See feedback as kind
    * Be an empowered receiver
2. **Know thyself**
    * Truth triggers
        * Seems wrong or off target
    * Relationship triggers
        * Something about our relationship with the person
    * Identity triggers
        * Undermines how we see ourselves
    * Wrong spotting - we look out for what is wrong rather than what is right with feedback. See past the wrong spotting to extract what is useful about the feedback.
    * We have blind spots (how I see me vs how you see me)
    * How do we build resilience? Understand your profile
        * Happiness set point
            * Take the oxford happiness questionnaire
        * Swing how wide do you swing? (high highs, low lows)
    * Recovery and sustain - how long does it take you to return to your baseline happiness? How long can you hold a good feeling?
3. **Understand Feedback**
    * 3 Types of Feedback: _Appreciation_, _Evaluation_, _Coaching_
    * Manage expectations about the type of feedback we want/ want to give
        * Appreciation: acknowledge, connect, motivate, reassure, thank
        * Evaluation: To rank or rate against a set of standards, align expectations, inform decision-making
        * Coaching: To help receiver expand knowledge, sharpen skill, improve capability
        * They **all** help us grow and improve.
4. **Use a Framework**
    * **A.S.K.** - _Actionable_, _Specific_, _Kind_.
        * Communication stances. Don't be a doormat or a sword, be a lantern
    * **NVC** (Non-violent communication). When I see/hear... I feel... Because I need... Would you be willing...?
5. Tips for giving feedback

    * state purpose of your feedback
    * thanks for listening
6. For receiving
    * make sure you are ing right headspace for it
    * be aware of triggers
    * know your feedback profile, BLH, swing, recovery/sustain
    * thank the giver
